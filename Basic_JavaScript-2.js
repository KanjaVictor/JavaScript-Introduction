//Equality Operator( == )
/*
The equality operator compares two values
and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not.

Can compare different data types: Strings and integers.
Done through coercion.The data type is converted to one of the data types and then a comparison is made.
*/

//Strict Equality Operator( === )
/*
Unlike the equality counterpart, no conversion is performed.
If different data types are used they're considered unequal.
*/

//Inequality Operator ( != )

//Strict Inequality Operator( !== )

//Greater than Operator( > )

//Greater than or Equal to Operator( >= )

//Less than Operator( < )

//Less tnan of Equal to Operator( <= )
